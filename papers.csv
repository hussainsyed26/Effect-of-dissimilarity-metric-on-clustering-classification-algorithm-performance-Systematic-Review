Comparison of different similarity measures in hierarchical clustering,M. Vagni; N. Giordano; G. Balestra; S.

Clustering represents a powerful method, used in data mining, for extracting new useful knowledge from unlabeled datasets. Clustering methods are essentially distance-based, since they measure the similarity (or the distance) between two elements or one element and the cluster centroid. However, the selection of the distance metric is not a trivial task: it could influence the clustering results and, thus, the extracted information. In this study we analyze the impact of four similarity measures (Manhattan or L1 distance, Euclidean or L2 distance, Chebyshev or L‚àû distance and Gower distance) on the clustering results obtained for datasets containing different types of variables. We applied hierarchical clustering combined with an automatic cut point selection method to six datasets publicly available on the UCI Repository. Four different clusterizations were obtained for every dataset (one for each distance) and were analyzed in terms of number of clusters, number of elements in each cluster, and cluster centroids. Our results showed that changing the distance metric produces substantial modifications in the obtained clusters. This behavior is particularly evident for datasets containing heterogeneous variables. Thus, the choice of the distance measure should not be done a-priori but evaluated according to the set of data to be analyzed and the task to be accomplished.",,978-1-6654-1914-7,10.1109/MeMeA52024.2021.9478746,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478746,similarity measures;distance measures;Gower distance;hierarchical clustering;UCI repository,Measurement;Precision medicine;Clustering methods;Chebyshev approximation;Genetics;Data mining;Task analysis,data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering,Chebyshev distance;life-style information;clusterizations;genetic life-style information;precision medicine;crucial point;similarity measures;distance measure;heterogeneous variables;automatic cut point selection method;hierarchical clustering;Gower distance;L‚àû distance;distance metric;cluster centroid;clustering methods;unlabeled datasets;data mining,,,,19,,12-Jul-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,yes,yes,no,yes,selection; comparison; data-depedent,Selection Criteria,"""The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of different similarity measures on the clustering results obtained for datasets containing different types of variables."" pg.2.

A Discounted Fuzzy Relational Clustering of Web Users‚Äô Using Intuitive Augmented Sessions Dissimilarity Metric,D. S. Sisodia; S. Verma; O. P.

Though RFC algorithms are very sensitive to cluster initialization and works only if the numbers of clusters are specified in advance. However, at all times, the prior initialization of a number of clusters is not feasible due to the dynamically evolving nature of user sessions. Therefore, estimating the number of clusters and initializing suitable cluster prototype are a significant performance bottleneck in this method. In this paper, the discounted fuzzy relational clustering (DFRC) algorithm is proposed to address the major constraint of RFC. The DFRC algorithm identifies Web user session clusters from Web server access logs, without initializing the number of clusters and prototypes of initial clusters. The DFRC algorithm works in two stages. In the first stage, DFRC automatically identifies the number of potential clusters based on the successively discounted potential density function value of each relational data and their respective centres. In the second stage, DFRC assigns fuzzy membership values to each data point and forms fuzzy clusters from the relational matrix. The DFRC algorithm is applied on an augmented session dissimilarity matrix obtained from a publicly accessed NASA Web server log data. The experimental results are evaluated using different fuzzy validity measures. The extensive experiments are performed to test the effect of various parameters, including accept/reject ratio and neighbourhood radius on the performance of DFRC algorithm. The results were also compared with fuzzy relational clustering algorithm using cluster quality measures.

The primary assumption of the proposed cross-domain distance metric learning (CDDML) framework is that training data are adequate in the source domain but limited in the target domain. One major problem of cross-domain scene classification caused by different dates, sensor positions, lighting conditions, and sensor types is data distribution bias. To solve this problem, the CDDML framework first replaces the existing color space with the proposed hybrid color features derived from all candidate color components to decrease the spectral shift between domains. Then, hybrid color features and bag of convolution features (BOCFs) are put into a discriminating DML (DDML) method to reduce the data distribution bias in the feature space. Finally, the image-to-subcategory distance measure is proposed to decrease the effect of intraclass variability on the nearest neighbor classifier by fusing hybrid color features and BOCF in the distance space.

Various penalized logistic regression models have been widely used to perform sample classification and gene selection. Typical penalization methods include Lasso, adaptive Lasso, group Lasso and so on. Group Lasso can well identify closely related informative gene groups, which has better performance when there are high correlation structures in the data. However, the group Lasso relies on efficient data clustering algorithms and similarity measures. The frequently used k-means clustering algorithm can classify data into k groups, however, the final results are unstable, which severely relies on initial setting and similarity measures. In this paper, we introduce k-shape into the group Lasso for logistic regression, and we compare the effect of different clustering algorithms both in simulated and real-world biological data. We find that the group Lasso with the k-shape algorithm has good performance, which is comparatively more precision and stable than those with the traditional k-means algorithms.

Three RNA secondary structure similarity metrics (base pair distance, tree edit distance, and thermodynamic energy distance) and their effects on the clustering algorithm were explored.

The major contribution of ADFLICM is use of the new fuzzy local similarity measure based on pixel spatial attraction model, which adaptively determines the weighting factors for neighboring pixel effects without any experimentally set parameters. The weighting factor for each neighborhood is fully adaptive to the image content, and the balance between insensitiveness to noise and reduction of edge blurring artifact to preserve image details is automatically achieved by using the new fuzzy local similarity measure.

One of the most vital area in the field of medical is the healthcare of expecting women in low income countries. High mortality rate due to increased number of caesarean section is evident because of poor medical infrastructure in the region, misunderstood religious teachings, low education and lack of proper decision making at the right time. The root cause analysis of situations demanding caesarean section is a tough job, however in the presence of historical data, one may extract useful information that will help supporting a medical decision by predicting the outcome.

For the domain of health and wellbeing such personalisation can contribute to better interventions and improved health states of users. In order for personalisation to be effective in this domain, it needs to be performed quickly and with minimal impact on the users. Reinforcement learning is one of the techniques that can be used to establish such personalisation, but it is not known to be very fast at learning. Cluster-based reinforcement learning has been proposed to improve the learning speed. Here, users who show similar behaviour are clustered and one policy is learned for each individual cluster. An important factor in this effort is the method used for clustering, which has the potential to influence the benefit of such an approach. In this paper, we propose three distance metrics based on the state of the users (Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping, and high-level features) and apply different clustering techniques given these distance metrics to study their impact on the overall performance. We evaluate the different methods in a simulator with users spawned from very distinct user profiles as well as overlapping user profiles.

The relationship among the energy consumption, the device electronic energy and the one-hop transmission distance is analyzed, and then the inverse ratio of the energy consumption increment to the cube of the optimal one-hop distance is gained. So, the clustering algorithm based on the optimal one-hop distance is given to reduce energy consumption. All sensor nodes are divided into different static clusters based on the optimum one-hop distance, and the distance between the fore-and-aft adjacent cluster heads equals or approximates to the optimum one-hop distance, which reduces the energy consumption for inter-cluster communication. At the same time, cluster head acts continuously as local control center and will not be replaced by the candidate cluster head until it almost exhausts its energy supply, which can lessen energy consumption for establishing the new cluster head.

In the last few years, adopting ensemble methods for credit scoring has become much more popular. However, the performance of ensemble methods is easily affected by the parameter settings and the number of base classifiers. Ensemble classification based on clustering is able to determine the best number of base classifiers automatically by clustering and find optimal parameter settings for base classifiers by training them individually on the training subsets combined by clusters. By this way, the adverse effect of manually setting the parameters and the number of base classifiers can be avoided. However, the different contributions of attributes to the distance metrics are not considered in conventional clustering methods, which may decrease the performance of ensemble classifiers based on them. Moreover, unbalanced training subsets decrease the performance of base classifiers, which results in the bad performance of ensemble classifiers. In our approach, to address the above problems, we first assign different weights to different variables when measuring the distance between two instances in the clustering step, and then adopt Subagging resampling method to deal with unbalanced training subsets in the training process.

This collective labelling mitigates the negative impact of noise by relying on group behaviour rather than individual characteristics of incoming samples. Second, since grouping and labelling new samples may be time-consuming, we summarize clusters using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Not only does GMM offer faster processing speed; it also facilitates summarizing clusters with arbitrary shape, and consequently, reducing the memory space requirement. Finally, a modified distance measure, based on Kullback-Liebner method, is proposed to calculate the similarity among clusters represented by GMMs. We evaluate the proposed method on various datasets by measuring its false alarm rate, detection rate and memory requirement.

Automatically classifying and grouping auditory scenes with similar semantics into categories is beneficial for many multimedia applications, such as semantic event detection and indexing. For such semantic categorization, auditory scenes are first characterized with either low-level acoustic features or some mid-level representations like audio effects, and then supervised classifiers or unsupervised clustering algorithms are employed to group scene segments into various semantic categories. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically categorizing audio scenes in unsupervised manner. To achieve more reasonable clustering results, we introduce the co-clustering scheme to exploit potential grouping trends among different dimensions of feature spaces (either low-level or mid-level feature spaces), and provide more accurate similarity measure for comparing auditory scenes. Moreover, we also extend the co-clustering scheme with a strategy based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to automatically estimate the numbers of clusters. Evaluation performed on 272 auditory scenes extracted from 12-h audio data shows very encouraging categorization results. Co-clustering achieved a better performance compared to some traditional one-way clustering algorithms, both based on the low-level acoustic features and on the mid-level audio effect representations.

Being able to more effectively identify patterns in socio-demographic longitudinal data is an important component in a number of social science settings. However, performing fundamental analytical operations, such as clustering for grouping these data based on similarity patterns, is challenging due to the categorical and multi-dimensional nature of the data, and their corruption by missing and inconsistent values. To study these data quality issues, we employ longitudinal sequence data representations, a similarity measure designed for categorical and longitudinal data, together with state-of-the art clustering methodologies reliant on hierarchical algorithms. The key to quantifying the similarity and difference among data records is a distance metric. Given the categorical nature of our data, we employ an ‚Äúedit‚Äù type distance using Optimal Matching (OM).

Furthermore, malicious actions result in the infection of many machines at considerable monetary expense to affected end-users. Although anti-malware companies can detect malware, they generally rely on signature-based methods. Because attackers use automated malware generation tools to generate new or modified malware that leads to increased instances and variants of malware, variants of the same malware class can often evade such methods. In this study, we propose a system based on structural sequence comparison and probabilistic similarity measures for detecting variants of a malware class. We believe that the structural sequence of malware behavior can detect variants of the same malware class by profiling the relationship between different behavior patterns. Furthermore, probabilistic similarity measures are used for discovering the behavior patterns of the sequential relation and finding very similar behavior models of malware classes. The proposed system, which incorporates a structural sequence mechanism and probabilistic similarity measurement, can be helpful for detecting and discovering variants of a malware class. The results of our experiment show that the proposed system detects variants of a malware class more effectively than a two-gram sequence does, and it lowers the effect and weight of behavior patterns, with higher precision and F-measure in variants of malware detection than the approach based on a two-gram sequence and normalized embedding function.",0730-3157,978-0-7695-4986-6,10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.60,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6649847,malware detection;sequential data;Markov chain;similarity measures,Malware;Probabilistic logic;Software;Mathematical model;Markov processes;Monitoring;Companies,invasive software;pattern clustering;statistical analysis,F-measure;normalized embedding function;two-gram sequence;probabilistic similarity measurement;structural sequence mechanism;malware class variants;probabilistic similarity measures;structural sequence comparison;automated malware generation tools;malware detection;signature-based methods;monetary expense;private information stealing action;malicious files downloading action;spam sending action;malicious actions;end-user computing devices;malicious software;structural host-sequence comparison;similar malware behavior clustering,,1,1,34,,31-Oct-13,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,yes,yes,no,yes,modified/anomalous metric,Modified/derived/anomalous metrics for better performance,"""For clustering closely similar malicious behavior of malware variants, we used a probabilistic similarity based on length-normalized log-likelihood

They are widely employed for studying many different aspects of gene regulation and function, ranging from understanding the global cell-cycle control of microorganisms to cancer in humans. Gene expression microarray experiments often generate data sets with multiple missing values. Many algorithms for gene expression data analysis require a complete data matrix and therefore, the accurate estimation of missing entries is crucial for their optimal usage. The latter has driven the development of various microarray imputation methods. However, most of these approaches are not particularly suitable for time series expression profiles. Moreover, their performance is not satisfactory for datasets with high rates of missing data or small numbers of samples. Another drawback of all these methods is that their estimation is based solely on a single expression matrix and no other additional data sources to impute the missing entries are used. Motivated by these, we propose herein an imputation algorithm that is particularly suited for the estimation of missing values in gene expression time series data using information that is contained in multiple related data sets. The proposed algorithm initially identifies an appropriate set of estimation matrices by using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance in order to measure similarities between gene expression matrices. Next it employs the same distance measure to evaluate the similarity between gene expression profiles and further applies a hybrid aggregation algorithm to combine the inter-gene similarities across the selected matrices in order to identify estimation genes. Then the expression profiles of those estimation genes are used to obtain the final imputation. The estimation accuracy of the proposed algorithm, called Integrative DTW-based Imputation (IDTWimpute), is benchmarked against that of two other imputation methods (KNNimpute and DTWimpute) in terms of root mean squared difference.

We have shown some numerical examples by the single linkage, an asymmetric single linkage, and the centroid method.
For the single linkage and asymmetric single linkage, the
penalty method works well, but dissimilarity modification
method does not work. This is because the single linkage uses
only the minimum dissimilarity when it calculates the dissimilarity between clusters. Moreover, the single linkage using the
penalty method often has a reversal in the dendrogram.
In contrast, both the penalty method and dissimilarity modification method work well in the centroid method. This is

Each of these applications, as well as many others where molecular comparison plays an important role, requires a different notion of similarity that naturally lead to the multicriteria PSC (MC-PSC) problem. Protein (Structure) Comparison, Knowledge, Similarity, and Information (ProCKSI) (www.procksi.org) provides algorithmic solutions for the MC-PSC problem by means of an enhanced structural comparison that relies on the principled application of information fusion to similarity assessments derived from multiple comparison methods. Current MC-PSC works well for moderately sized datasets and it is time consuming as it provides public service to multiple users. Many of the structural bioinformatics applications mentioned above would benefit from the ability to perform, for a dedicated user, thousands or tens of thousands of comparisons through multiple methods in real time, a capacity beyond our current technology. In this paper, we take a key step into that direction by means of a high-throughput distributed reimplementation of ProCKSI for very large datasets. The core of the proposed framework lies in the design of an innovative distributed algorithm that runs on each compute node in a cluster/grid environment to perform structure comparison of a given subset of input structures using some of the most popular PSC methods [e.g., universal similarity metric (USM), maximum contact map overlap (MaxCMO), fast alignment and search tool (FAST), distance alignment (DaliLite), combinatorial extension (CE), template modeling alignment (TMAlign)]. We follow this with a procedure of distributed consensus building. Thus, the new algorithms proposed here achieve ProCKSI's similarity assessment quality but with a fraction of the time required by it. Our results show that the proposed distributed method can be used efficiently to compare: 1) a particular protein against a very large protein structures dataset (target-against-all comparison), and 2) a particular very large-scale dataset against itself or against another very large-scale dataset (all-against-all comparison).

Most existing FRI methodologies are not developed for Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) inference models. TSK inference extension (TSK+) is one of the methodologies proposed for TSK models with sparse rule bases. It works by replacing matching degrees with similarity measures across all the given rules, instead of just the matched ones, to generate the final conclusion. However, those rules with low similarities bring bias to the final result, which is mainly determined by the closest rules. To significantly strengthen the efficacy of this, a novel framework is presented here through the use of just a small number of closest rules to derive the final outcome. Compared with TSK+, the proposed method reduces the computational overheads of the inference process while avoiding the adverse impact caused by the rules of low similarities with the new observation. More importantly, to deal with large sized sparse rule bases, where neighbourhood rules may be similar with each other, a rule-clustering approach is proposed. That is, a clustering algorithm (say, fuzzy c-means) is first employed to cluster rules into different groups and then, the final interpolated conclusion is computed by the use of the closest rules selected from a small number of closest rule clusters. This approach helps further decrease the time complexity. The efficacy of these two modified methods is demonstrated via systematic experimental comparisons against the performance of the original TSK+.",1558-4739,978-1-5386-1728-1,10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858833,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858833,Fuzzy inference system;TSK;Fuzzy rule interpolation;Rule clustering;K closest rules;Closest rule clusters,Interpolation;Time complexity;Fuzzy sets;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Fuzzy logic;Euclidean distance,fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;inference mechanisms;interpolation;knowledge based systems;pattern clustering,TSK+;inference process;low similarities;sized sparse rule bases;neighbourhood rules;rule-clustering approach;cluster rules;final interpolated conclusion;closest rules;closest rule clusters;original TSK;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang inference systems;fuzzy rule interpolation technique;infer conclusions;fuzzy rule-based system;sparse rule base;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang inference models;TSK inference extension;TSK models;final conclusion;FRI methodologies,,2,,21,,11-Oct-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,no,no,,,,,

A large number of biclustering algorithms has been developed for analyzing gene expression data. Most of them find exclusive biclusters, which is inappropriate in the biological context. Since biological processes are not independent of each other, many genes participate in multiple different processes. Hence, nonexclusive biclustering algorithms are required for finding highly overlapping biclusters. In this regard, a novel overlapping biclustering algorithm is presented here to find overlapping biclusters of larger volume with mean squared residue lower than a given threshold. The proposed method consists of two phases. First, a set of highly coherent seeds is generated based on two-way k-medoids algorithm, where mutual information is used as a similarity measure instead of using Euclidean distance. The seeds are then iteratively adjusted (enlarged or degenerated) by adding or removing genes and conditions based on a new quantitative index. In effect, the proposed method provides highly overlapping coherent biclusters with mean squared residue lower than a given threshold. Some quantitative indices are introduced for evaluating the quality of generated biclusters. The quality of biclusters found by the proposed approach is discussed and the results are compared to those reported by existing methods. In general, the proposed approach shows an excellent performance at finding patterns in gene expression data.",,978-1-4244-2962-2,10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760441,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760441,,Gene expression;Data analysis;Data engineering;Algorithm design and analysis;Biological processes;Computer science;Educational institutions;Machine intelligence;Information technology;Information analysis,bioinformatics;data analysis;data mining;genetics;pattern clustering,biclustering algorithm;value-coherent overlapping delta-bicluster discovery;gene expression data analysis;gene expression measurement;biological process;mean squared residue;two-way k-medoids algorithm;Euclidean distance;similarity measure;quantitative index,,3,,34,,23-Jan-09,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,yes,yes,no,yes,comparison; modified/anomalous metric,Modified/derived/anomalous metrics for better performance,"""In general, Euclidean distance and Pearsonís correlation coefficient are widely used as the distance or similarity measures

A New Approach to Batch Effect Removal Based on Distribution Matching in Latent Space,H. Li; H. Dogan; J.

However, biological measurements can be easily affected by systematic variations especially when those measures are obtained from distinct batches involving different platforms and experimental conditions. Such batch effect is usually larger than biological signal of interest and can cause invalid downstream analysis and false discovery if not properly handled. Here we proposed a new learning approach based on multivariate distribution matching in the latent space for batch effect removal while preserving signals of most interest. This new data-driven approach consists of three key components: an autoencoder trained to encode the data into low-dimension neurons that represent data pattern; a similarity measurement procedure to identify batch-effect associated neurons; and a residual network-based matching framework to transform the affected neurons' distribution from one batch to another where the adjusted neurons will be decoded to reconstruct new datasets with batch effect removed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated in several ways using public genomic data on Alzheimer disease.

Anisotropies in the redshift-space correlations of galaxy groups and clusters ‚Äî II. Analysis of observational cluster samples,N. D. Padilla; D. G. Lambas,NA; NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,18-Jan-18,2003,342,2,532,542,"We study the redshift-space correlation function of galaxy clusters for observational samples constructed in different surveys. We explore correlation amplitudes, pairwise velocity distributions and bias factors. Systematic effects in cluster identification procedures are the main source of biased estimates of the correlation amplitude and inferred velocity dispersions. We find that the large elongations along the line of sight in the Abell catalogue cannot be explained solely in terms of the errors in distance measurement originating from using a small number of galaxies. The inclusion of a significant fraction of galaxies and systems not physically bound to the clusters is responsible for this large systematic effect. We also find a significant dependence of the redshift-space distortion of the correlation function on the cluster Bautz‚ÄìMorgan (BM) type, an effect that may rely on the fact that, owing to the regular appearance of low Bautz‚ÄìMorgan type clusters, a sample of such objects would be less contaminated. We confirm that the effect of a low number of redshift measurements, n<inf>z</inf>, is to increase the redshift-space correlation length and bias factor. The results are very stable for n<inf>z</inf> > 10. We also test the effects of different n<inf>z</inf> in the catalogue of groups/clusters derived from the Updated Zwicky Catalogue and find that, for cluster samples identified in redshift surveys, even a low number of redshifts n<inf>z</inf>‚àº 5 is sufficient to provide reliable results. By comparing our results with those of numerical simulations we explore the strong influence on the clustering distortion pattern in redshift space from effects associated with the cluster identification procedure from two-dimensional surveys. The identification of clusters in X-ray surveys improves this situation, although there are still systematic effects, which are probably due to identification of optical sources in the determination of cluster redshifts. These systematic effects are particularly strong for the most luminous X-ray-selected clusters in the Extended Bright Cluster Survey, which exhibits very large anisotropies, comparable to those present in the Abell catalogue. Our results demonstrate that forthcoming large redshift surveys will be extremely important for the construction of new samples of groups and clusters, as well as improving the determination of optical and X-ray-selected cluster distances, essential for reliable analyses of the large-scale structure.High-resolution plots and information are available at.",1365-2966,,10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06570.x,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148686,methods: numerical;methods: statistical;galaxies: clusters: general;large-scale structure of Universe,,,,,,,,,18-Jan-18,,,OUP,OUP Journals,no,no,,,,,

Improved K-mean clustering method with weighted likelihood (WLD) similarity measure is employed to group the active users within a given region. After grouping the users, different scheduling methods, semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS) algorithm and greedy algorithm, are implemented. Initially, grouping and scheduling are performed based on the static channels. Then, the scheduled users are simultaneously served for the next time frames without rescheduling while the users are moving. With this approach, this paper reveals how static and time-varying user grouping and scheduling methods perform in terms of system sum-rate when the fast moving users experience the Doppler effect. Different scenarios of number of active users and time frames are simulated.

As the beginning work, a brief screening algorithm is described to decrease the time consumption for the framework.The electrical alternans, especially the T wave alternans (TWA), is considered as the danger symptom to sudden cardiac death (SCD). The current methods identifying TWA are reviewed summarily. They are concluded into three types, i.e. time-domain methods, frequency-domain methods and statistical tests. All of the time-domain methods can be induced to dynamical pattern recognition framework. Based on the framework, the comparison between T waveforms is in fact to calculate the similarity of each other. Thus the similarity measures which are appropriate for time series are discussed. Because the alternans pattern concerns only the neighbor waves, it is feasible to eliminate the T waves without alternans by comparing consecutive three or four T waves. With a group of simple inequations, the fast screening algorithm can get rid of about half of the data from further calculation and comparison.

Local Feature Weighting in Nearest Prototype Classification,F. Fernandez; P. Isasi,"Univ. Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid; Univ.

That is because they classify depending on the similarity of the data. When the data is characterized by a set of features which may contribute to the classification task in different levels, feature weighting or selection is required, sometimes in a local sense. However, local weighting is typically restricted to NN approaches. In this paper, we introduce local feature weighting (LFW) in NP classification. LFW provides each prototype its own weight vector, opposite to typical global weighting methods found in the NP literature, where all the prototypes share the same one. Providing each prototype its own weight vector has a novel effect in the borders of the Voronoi regions generated: They become nonlinear. We have integrated LFW with a previously developed evolutionary nearest prototype classifier (ENPC). The experiments performed both in artificial and real data sets demonstrate that the resulting algorithm that we call LFW in nearest prototype classification (LFW-NPC) avoids overfitting on training data in domains where the features may have different contribution to the classification task in different areas of the feature space.

In order to overcome this deficit, object detection and clustering methods are investigated in this research as it is in line with Smart Farming 4.0. Faster RCNN is used to help ranchers to detect livestock while clustering methods help to detect the herds and outliers effectively and efficiently. In clustering methods, K-means clustering technique and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise or DBScan clustering technique are adopted. In K-means clustering, k is an important parameter which represents the number of clusters. By changing the number of clusters, the pattern of clusters is observed. Then, the best k value is selected. In DBScan clustering, epsilon is an important parameter which represents the circle radius from a particular data point. The higher the value of epsilon, the formation of clusters becomes easier as it is easy to accept data point in a larger circle radius to form cluster. By changing the epsilon, the pattern of cluster is observed and chosen. Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance are used to compare the effects of different distance metrics on the results of clusters. Cluster pattern is compared between K-means and DBScan techniques.

VFIs cluster cores that share the same Voltage/Frequency (V/F) level for the entire application runtime. Using VFIs, switching V/F levels has less overhead per-core while saving more energy in exchange for tolerable execution delay. This paper targets the well-known K-means algorithm for clustering cores, where each cluster contains cores with similar computational workloads across applications phases. K-means produces sub-optimal clusters when cores workloads do not have the same variation across all phases. Furthermore, the workload variations require running a VFI with a different V/F level per-phase. This paper presents a fast heuristic that facilitates clustering by sorting computational workloads per-phase before applying K-means. The VFIs V/F levels are dynamically adjusted to meet energy budget constraints. This framework provides a guideline for users to choose a number of clusters that satisfies system configurations and energy efficiency preferences. Three parameters are evaluated to represent the computational workloads: utilization, Instruction-Per-Cycle (IPC), and execution time. For an application with highly varying workload, execution time achieves 52 and 65% more energy efficiency compared to utilization and IPC, respectively.

Such metrics respect graph topology when a is small, and reproduce well-known metrics such as hitting times and the pseudo-inverse of graph Laplacian with different regularizer Œõ. This paper is the first to analyze the important impact of selecting Œõ in retrieving the local cluster from a seed. We find that different Œõ can lead to surprisingly complementary behaviors: Œõ = D (degree matrix) can reliably extract the cluster of a query if it is sparser than surrounding clusters, while Œõ = I (identity matrix) is preferred if it is denser than surrounding clusters. Since in practice there is no reliable way to determine the local density in order to select the right model, we propose a new design of Œõ that automatically adapts to the local density.

Such a similarity measure has many applications, including classification and clustering of network instances, evaluation of network sampling methods, anomaly detection and study of epidemic dynamics. The existing methods are unable to effectively capture the similarity of degree distributions, particularly when the corresponding networks have different sizes.

However, the performance of WSNs is adversely impacted by fading effects, which requires much energy to combat for a high Bit Error Rate (BER) requirement. On the other hand, since the transmit energy is proportional to transmit distance, energy imbalance is caused by the different distances to the Base Station (BS). Sensor nodes far from the BS consume much more energy than those close to the BS and may die out quickly, which shortens the lifetime or results in a malfunction of the WSN. Reducing the proportion of transmit energy in total energy consumption helps minimize the differences in transmit energy among sensor nodes. Cooperative transmission has been proven to be an effective way to combat the impacts of fading by obtaining diversity gains and therefore, reduces the transmit energy. In this paper, we first apply cooperative transmission in WSNs, which not only reduces energy consumption but also lessens the differences of energy consumption among sensor nodes. To further balance energy among sensor nodes, we apply different cluster size and simulation results show that unequal cluster size improves energy balancing.",,978-3-8007-3102-2,10.1109/EW.2008.4623879,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4623879,,Wireless sensor networks;Distance measurement;Energy consumption;Wireless communication;Receivers;Protocols;Bit error rate,error statistics;wireless sensor networks,energy balance;cooperative wireless sensor network;bit error rate;cooperative transmission;diversity gains,,6,,7,,12-Sep-08,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,no,no,,,,,
Big Data-Driven Brain Parcellation from fMRI: Impact of Cohort Heterogeneity on Functional Connectivity Maps,S. J. Brooks; S. M. Parks; C.

However, despite their promise and many strengths, these data are highly heterogeneous, a characteristic that may affect the anatomical accuracy and generalization of the template but has received relatively little attention. Using multiple similarity measures and thresholding approaches, this study investigated the topological intra- and inter-individual variability of restingstate (rs) functional edge maps (often used for brain parcellation), estimated from rs-fMRI connectivity in n = 5878 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Findings from this initial investigation indicate that choosing a subject- vs cohort-based threshold for estimating edge maps from connectivity matrices does not significantly impact the map topology. In contrast, the choice of similarity measure and non-linear relationship between similarity and edge map sparsity may have a significant impact on map classification and the generation of parcellation atlases. Multi-level classification revealed multiple clusters with a potentially complex mapping onto biological variables beyond simple demographics.Clinical Relevance‚Äî Case-control neuroimaging studies should use domain-specific (e.g., demographics-specific) atlases for parcellating the brain, to improve accuracy and rigor of cohort comparisons. To be generalizable, such atlases need to be derived from large datasets, which are inherently heterogeneous.

Group-based sparse representation, which utilizes the concept of a group as the basic unit of sparse representation instead of a patch, is introduced as the image domain prior regularization term to eliminate the over-smoothing effect. By grouping the nonlocal patches into different clusters with similarity measured by Euclidean distance, the sparsity and nonlocal similarity in a single image are simultaneously explored.

However, this is only possible when correctly detecting the first path of the incoming signal instead of a bounce or a reflection, which becomes challenging in non line-of-sight (NLOS) situations. There are many different approaches in the literature to alleviate the wrong detection of the first incoming UWB signal path. One of them considers machine learning techniques to design classifiers capable of distinguishing between line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS propagation from available signal features. However, the performance and complexity of the obtained classifiers depend largely on the size of the input data associated to such features. Thus, features such as the channel impulse response (CIR) produce large amounts of data, yielding very complex classifiers. In this paper, we propose using a downsampled power delay profile (PDP) as an alternative feature consisting of input data much smaller than the CIR, although sufficiently representative, hence resulting in a lower computational cost while exhibiting a similar classification performance. Furthermore, another of the tasks addressed in this work is the study of the impact on the classification results of using a dataset for training where the samples of each class are not balanced from the point of view of energy.

First, a hierarchical version of the refined five-component decomposition is proposed. The derived scattering features along with other well-used features are then combined to construct a low-dimensional feature vector. Second, a modified normalized cuts formulation using a distance measurement is presented, in which the feature similarity and the space proximity are both considered. During the superpixel segmentation, the edge information derived from our scattering mechanism-optimal contrast-based edge detector is incorporated. On this basis, a tradeoff factor according to the edge information and the equivalent number of looks is determined, which balances the relationship of feature similarity and space proximity so as to adaptively control the size and shape of superpixels.

To feed such data hungry systems, we need an equally robust distributed file systems that span across multiple geographically separate locations. Most distributed file systems break any file into a set of blocks or chunks which are spread across the cluster. The major bottleneck is to identify where to place the blocks and where to place the replicas so that cluster is optimized on certain parameters like disk utilization, minimizing network congestion, maximizing throughput, optimal power utilization, etc. This paper proposes assigning a distance measure for each one of the data sources with respect to the other and placing the blocks on the specified disk on the node that minimizes the total distance of the last few requests made for that block. As the request pattern and parameters change, the distances are updated and the blocks are moved dynamically to minimized the distance, in effect optimizing on the required parameters. The distance function is to be modeled based on the cluster and the parameters you wish to optimize on. It can be a function of just bandwidth or bandwidth and latency or other miscellaneous features like disk utilization, processing power, disk speed, power utilization, cooling requirements, temperature, etc. A detailed performance analysis was carried out with disk bandwidth, network bandwidth and disk utilization as the parameters and the performance is far better in comparison to the reference system (10\% or more depending on specification differences) which has no understanding of the different type of disks present and the nature of the cluster.

Fuzzy logic for mining episodal association rules in time series,Bingxue Wang; Yuanzhong Chen,"School of Information Management & Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance & Economics, 200433, China; School of Information Management & Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance & Economics, 200433, China",2009 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems,28-Dec-09,2009,1,,837,841,"The aim of the study reported in this paper is to use fuzzy logic to discover episodal association rules between local patterns in time series. Our method is different from other time series mining methods which mainly compare sub-series with Euclidean distance measure or its transfiguration. In order to form a sub-series, we put down values of a time series to recordset's attributes, slide a window through the attributes, and normalize them with a simple method. We cluster the normalized sub-series by fuzzy clustering to obtain its delegates which represent local episodes. We calculate rule's support and confidence with membership and each sample does not arbitrarily support a single symbol so as to make the two important measures more exact and actual. We select good rules with J-measure based on membership. Stock index series are utilized to show the feasibility of the method, and empirical results show that we are able to achieve a higher SV accuracy and confidence.",,978-1-4244-4754-1,10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358037,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358037,data mining;time series;episodal association rules;fuzzy logic,Fuzzy logic;Data mining;Association rules;Fuzzy sets;Time measurement;Information management;Finance;Economic forecasting;Delay effects;Forward contracts,data mining;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;time series,fuzzy logic;episodal association rules;time series;Euclidean distance;fuzzy clustering;stock index series,,1,,13,,28-Dec-09,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,yes,yes,no,no,,,

Resources such as spectrum will be wasted if the network is not density-aware and -adaptive. Towards this aim, distributed and robust network density estimators are required. In this paper, we propose a novel cluster density estimator in random ad hoc networks by employing distance matrix. Monte-Carlo simulation results validate the proposed estimator in addition to comparison with two different estimators. The accuracy of the estimator is impressive even under a high amount of distance measurement errors. We also demonstrate impact of density on network outage and transmission power adaption via proposing 2-D analytic models based on density and validating these models with the proposed density estimator.",2157-4960,978-1-5386-3662-6,10.1109/NTMS.2018.8328688,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328688,Ad hoc networks;density-awareness;densityestimation;distance estimation;outage probability;mobility,Ad hoc networks;Estimation;Power system reliability;Probability;Indexes;Fading channels;Shadow mapping,ad hoc networks;estimation theory;mobile radio;Monte Carlo methods;radio spectrum management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling,clustered ad hoc networks;mobile stations;sleep scheduling;Monte-Carlo simulation results;network outage,,1,,10,,02-Apr-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,no,no,,,,,
Language classification using prosodic features: Comparing intensity and pitch,P. N.

Distance measures have been used in several applications of speech processing to analyze different varying speech attributes. However, not much work has been done on language distance measures, and even less work has been done involving South African languages. Prosodic information-such as intonation and stress which are primarily encoded in pitch and intensity-have been known to lend language-specific variations to human language. We explore the use of intensity and pitch characteristics of languages for measuring the linguistic distance of six South African languages. Both methods are acoustic based and compare accumulative mean differences between pairs of languages to generate difference matrices. It is shown that cluster analysis resulting from the pitch distance matrix correlates closely with human perceptual distances and existing literature about the six languages whereas intensity distances show no distinct patterns of correlation.",,978-1-4799-6656-1,10.1109/SCAT.2013.7055100,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7055100,Prosody;language distance;pitch;intensity,Speech;Stress;Information science;Telecommunications;Pragmatics;Acoustics;Current measurement,acoustic signal processing;natural language processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;speech processing,language classification;prosodic features;linguistic distance;South African languages;accumulative mean differences;difference matrices;cluster analysis;pitch distance matrix;human perceptual distances;intensity distance matrix,,1,,20,,05-Mar-15,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,no,no,,,,,
Fully Unsupervised Person Re-Identification via Multiple Pseudo Labels Joint Training,Q. Tang; G. Cao; K. -H.

Because annotating images across multiple cameras is difficult and time-consuming, this paper focuses on fully unsupervised learning person re-ID that can learn person re-ID on unlabeled data. The unsupervised re-ID needs to self-generate pseudo labels to make training possible. Unlike human-annotated true labels, the pseudo labels contain noise labels which substantially hinder the network‚Äôs capability on feature learning. In order to refine the predicted pseudo labels, we introduce a novel unsupervised re-ID method named Multiple pseudo Labels Joint Training (MLJT) in this paper. Different from the existing works, the MLJT predicts multiple pseudo labels for each image by mining potential similarities in multiple ways. Based on invariance constraints among multiple pseudo labels, the MLJT is jointly optimized under the supervision of multiple pseudo labels to ease the impact of noises in the single pseudo label. The proposed MLJT predicts three types of pseudo labels for one input image. The first one is the clustering-based pseudo label. The second one is adaptive similarity measurement-based pseudo label. The third one is pseudo sub-labels which are predicted by mining channel-based self-similarities. The proposed MLJT has been extensively evaluated on two mainstream and public person re-ID datasets and outdoor real-world videos. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiple pseudo labels joint training strategy and the practicality of the proposed MLJT in real-world unsupervised person re-ID applications.

Spatiotemporal methods for prostate cancer detection by contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging,M. P. J. Kuenen; T. A. Saidov; M. Mischi; H. Wijkstra,"Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands; Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands; Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands; Academic Medical Center University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",2012 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium,18-Jul-13,2012,,,1331,1334,"Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed form of cancer in men in western countries. The lack of reliable imaging solutions currently restricts treatment options to radical interventions. Reliable imaging of angiogenesis, which correlates with cancer aggressiveness, could enable efficient targeting of biopsies and focal therapies, but the complicated effects of angiogenesis on perfusion have prevented a breakthrough so far. As an alternative, contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI) has been proposed to obtain a better characterization of angiogenenic microvascular changes. CUDI makes use of dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging after an intravenous contrast-agent bolus injection. Dispersion is estimated by spatiotemporal analysis of time-intensity curves (TICs) obtained at each pixel. Here we present an analytical framework for a dispersion analysis by estimation of the spatial TIC similarity. Data preprocessing is improved by a spatial Wiener deconvolution filter, which reduces the effects of the anisotropic spatial ultrasound resolution, and by TIC time windowing. In addition, we propose the TIC correlation coefficient as a new TIC similarity measure. A comparison of the resulting dispersion maps from 7 recordings with histology, obtained after radical prostatectomy, showed an increased spatial similarity in the presence of cancer in all patients. The cancer classification performance of CUDI was superior to all perfusion-related parameters and was improved by spatial filtering and windowing. Although an extended validation is required, these results confirm the promising value of CUDI for prostate cancer detection.",1051-0117,978-1-4673-4562-0,10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0332,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562381,,Imaging;Dispersion;Speckle;Ultrasonic imaging;Prostate cancer;Correlation,biological organs;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;deconvolution;spatial filters;spatiotemporal phenomena;Wiener filters,spatiotemporal method;prostate cancer detection;contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging;angiogenesis imaging;biopsy;focal therapy;angiogenenic microvascular change characterization;intravenous contrast-agent bolus injection;spatiotemporal analysis;spatial TIC similarity estimation;data preprocessing;spatial Wiener deconvolution filter;anisotropic spatial ultrasound resolution;time-intensity curve time windowing;time-intensity curve correlation coefficient;radical prostatectomy;cancer classification performance;perfusion-related parameter,,,,16,,18-Jul-13,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,no,no,,,,,
How does the grouping scheme affect the Wiener Filter reconstruction of the local Universe?,J. G. Sorce; E. Tempel,NA; NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,19-Jan-18,2017,469,3,2859,2868,"High-quality reconstructions of the three-dimensional velocity and density fields of the local Universe are essential to study the local large scale structure. In this paper, the Wiener Filter reconstruction technique is applied to galaxy radial peculiar velocity catalogues to understand how the Hubble constant (H<inf>0</inf>) value and the grouping scheme affect the reconstructions. While H<inf>0</inf> is used to derive radial peculiar velocities from galaxy distance measurements and total velocities, the grouping scheme serves the purpose of removing non-linear motions. Two different grouping schemes (based on the literature and a systematic algorithm) as well as five H<inf>0</inf> values ranging from 72 to 76¬†km¬†s<sup>‚àí1</sup>¬†Mpc<sup>‚àí1</sup> are selected. The Wiener Filter is applied to the resulting catalogues. Whatever grouping scheme is used, the larger H<inf>0</inf> is, the larger the infall on to the local volume is. However, this conclusion has to be strongly mitigated: a bias minimization scheme applied to the catalogues after grouping suppresses this effect. At fixed H<inf>0</inf>, reconstructions obtained with catalogues grouped with the different schemes exhibit structures at the proper location in both cases but the latter are more contrasted in the less aggressive scheme case: Having more constraints permits an infall from both sides on to the structures to reinforce their overdensity. Such findings highlight the importance of a balance between grouping to suppress non-linear motions and preserving constraints to produce an infall on to structures expected to be large overdensities. Such an observation is promising to perform constrained simulations of the local Universe, including its massive clusters.",1365-2966,,10.1093/mnras/stx1057,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8212182,methods: numerical;techniques: radial velocities;galaxies: groups: general;large-scale structure of Universe,,,,,,,,,19-Jan-18,,,OUP,OUP Journals,no,no,,,,,
AMC-Loss: Angular Margin Contrastive Loss for Improved Explainability in Image Classification,H. Choi; A. Som; P.

These auxiliary loss functions facilitate better discrimination between the different classes of interest. However, recent studies hint at the fact that these loss functions do not take into account the intrinsic angular distribution exhibited by the low-level and high-level feature representations. This results in less compactness between samples from the same class and unclear boundary separations between data clusters of different classes. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing the use of geometric constraints, rooted in Riemannian geometry. Specifically, we propose Angular Margin Contrastive Loss (AMC-Loss), a new loss function to be used along with the traditional cross-entropy loss. The AMC-Loss employs the discriminative angular distance metric that is equivalent to geodesic distance on a hypersphere manifold such that it can serve a clear geometric interpretation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMC-Loss by providing quantitative and qualitative results. We find that although the proposed geometrically constrained loss-function improves quantitative results modestly, it has a qualitatively surprisingly beneficial effect on increasing the interpretability of deep-net decisions as seen by the visual explanations generated by techniques such as the Grad-CAM.
